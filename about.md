I currently work at [Invest in Open Infrastructure](https://investinopen.org) (IOI). Recognising that research and scholarship need open, community-driven infrastructure to thrive, IOI works to increase the investment in and the adoption of open infrastructure. As the Engagement Lead at IOI, I lead the design and execution of strategies and processes to ensure that IOI's research, products, strategic guidance, and recommendations are built _with_ stakeholders in the open infrastructure space, particularly those who are most impacted. Examples of my work include designing the participatory grantmaking process of [the Open Infrastructure Fund](https://investinopen.org/funding-pilots/oi-fund) and the community engagement and go-to-market strategy for the first iteration of [Infra Finder](https://infrafinder.investinopen.org).

My experience: I completed my PhD in neuroscience at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Rome, Italy in 2018. I then joined [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/about/technology) as Innovation Community Manager, where I helped build a community of open-source practitioners to advance the development of open-source tools to change the ways we consume, discover, share and evaluate research. Prior to joining IOI, I was the Open Science Community Engagement Manager at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). There, I led the communication and engagement efforts for the [TU Delft Open Science, Programme](https://www.tudelft.nl/open-science) and managed the [Open Science Community Delft](https://osc-delft.github.io). Between 2021 and 2024, I've also had the pleasure of serving as a Co-Director of [OLS](https://we-are-ols.org), a not-for-profit initiative dedicated to capacity building and diversifying leadership in research worldwide.

I'm passionate about:
- *Open & meaningful community designs* - designing community spaces and activities that bring together diverse backgrounds to safely share and learn from each other, build empathy, and map and pursue shared goals.
- *Strategic communication* - through listening and active community involvement, developing narratives and communication plans to deliver the right messages to the right people at the right time.
- *Sustainable and equitable innovation* - asking questions, listening to people to understand how we can build technology that's beneficial to all, together.

I currently live in Utrecht, the Netherlands, most known for [the fish doorbell](https://visdeurbel.nl/en/the-fish-doorbell/) and [Miffy museum](https://nijntjemuseum.nl/en/). I grew up in Hong Kong and have lived in the UK and Italy for long periods. I love travelling (mostly for the food), listen to too much mandopop, occasionally shoot B&W in film, and am trying to keep thrips off my many indoor plants.
