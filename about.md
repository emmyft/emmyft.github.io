I am the Community Engagement Manager (Open Science) for the Technical University of Delft (TU Delft). TU Delft's leadership has the ambition to [make open science the default way of doing science](link), white its vibrant scholars' community has also been experimenting with various ways of sharing their work and collaborating with others more openly. I design and build bridges between institutional leadership, scholars, and research support staff, to facilitate meaningful participation of scholars and change managers in open science policy and infrastructure design, and raise the community's awareness and interest in open science. I manage [Open Science Community Delft](https://osc-delft.github.io), and am a member of the interim Steering Committee of the International Network of Open Science Community (INOSC).

I co-organise [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org), a cohort-based training and mentorship programme to support individuals and stakeholders in research in becoming open science ambassadors.

My recent experience: I completed my PhD in neuroscience at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Rome, Italy in 2018. I then joined [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/about/technology) as Innovation Community Manager, where I helped build a community of open-source practitioners to advance the development of open-source tools to change the ways we consume, discover, share and evaluate research.

I'm passionate about:
- *Open & meaningful community designs* - designing community spaces and activities that bring together diverse backgrounds to safely share and learn from each other, build empathy, and map and pursue shared goals.
- *Strategic communication* - through listening and active community involvement, developing narratives and communication plans to deliver the right messages to the right people at the right time.
- *Sustainable and equitable innovation* - asking questions, listening to people to understand how we can build technology that's beneficial to all, together.

I am currently based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I grew up in Hong Kong and have lived in the UK and Italy for long periods. I love travelling (mostly for the food), listen to too much mandopop, occasionally shoot B&W in film and am trying to build a balcony vegetable garden.
