I currently work at [Invest in Open Infrastructure](https://investinopen.org)(IOI). Recognising that research and scholarship needs open, community-driven infrastructure to thrive, IOI is dedicated improving funding and resourcing for open technologies and systems. As the first Engagement Lead at IOI, I'm setting up communication processes and tools, and working with our team and community to build stategies to engage stakeholders in co-creating research, resources, and roadmaps to advance our shared mission.

I am also a Co-Director at [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org). We run a cohort-based training and mentorship programme to support individuals and stakeholders in research in becoming open science ambassadors.

My recent experience: I completed my PhD in neuroscience at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Rome, Italy in 2018. I then joined [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/about/technology) as Innovation Community Manager, where I helped build a community of open-source practitioners to advance the development of open-source tools to change the ways we consume, discover, share and evaluate research. Prior to joining IOI, I was the Open Science Community Engagement Manager at the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). There, I led the communication and engagement efforts for the [TU Delft Open Science, Programme](https://www.tudelft.nl/open-science) and managed the [Open Science Community Delft](https://osc-delft.github.io),

I'm passionate about:
- *Open & meaningful community designs* - designing community spaces and activities that bring together diverse backgrounds to safely share and learn from each other, build empathy, and map and pursue shared goals.
- *Strategic communication* - through listening and active community involvement, developing narratives and communication plans to deliver the right messages to the right people at the right time.
- *Sustainable and equitable innovation* - asking questions, listening to people to understand how we can build technology that's beneficial to all, together.

I am currently based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I grew up in Hong Kong and have lived in the UK and Italy for long periods. I love travelling (mostly for the food), listen to too much mandopop, occasionally shoot B&W in film and am trying to build a balcony vegetable garden.
