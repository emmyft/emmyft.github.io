## Technical work
- I managed [eLife Labs](https://elifesci.org/labs) between 2019 and 2020: inviting guest posts, evaluating content pitches, co-writing and editing. This deep-dive piece into reproducibility is one of my favourite (co-authored with Tyler Whitehouse and Dav Clark): [Rebooting reproducibility: From re-execution to replication](https://elifesciences.org/labs/6fb86e9c/rebooting-reproducibility-from-re-execution-to-replication)
- Editing [this report on a machine learning approach to dissect peer review reports](https://elifesciences.org/labs/abb00264/peertax-investigating-the-taxonomy-of-peer-reviews) (by Alessio Caciagli) was a memorable experience: the main task was the highlight the rationale behind this experiment, and walk readers through the logic behind each decision and the interpretation of the results.
- [The experiences of those who support researchers struggling with their mental health](https://www.notion.so/Detailed-CV-5c2748aa5cd74a738d4b2e20555d902f#12e6641a176a40b092a5dc37fbfa5e70) is a report on an international survey examining the nature of the relationships between researchers who struggle with their mental health, and those in the community who try to support them. The project was led by Elsa Loissel (Associate Features Editor, eLife); I contributed to the statistical modelling analysis of the survey data.

## People stories
- I currently run the series "Author Spotlight" for the TU Delft OPEN blog. This series shares authors' motivation and journeys behind open books, textbooks and research articles. In [this interview](https://openpublishing.tudl.tudelft.nl/author-spotlight-contextualising-80-years-of-aerospace-engineering-education-in-the-netherlands/) with Dr. Gillian Saunders, she shared the lessons learnt and surprises during the writing and publication of her open-access book.
-  "Innovator Stories" is an series I piloted for eLife Labs. It aims to bring into focus the people behind open-source projects for open science and to inspire others. For one of the pieces, ["Unlocking knowledge from PDFs"](https://elifesciences.org/labs/d181861d/innovator-story-unlocking-knowledge-from-pdfs), I interviewed Patrice Lopez about his motivations to develop GROBID, an tool to extract structured information from PDFs, open-source.
- During a mid-PhD meltdown, I documented [my own PhD and long-distance running journeys](https://blogs.embl.org/rome/2017/11/22/dont-do-a-phd/).
